# Car-Price-Prediction
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 5,512 car listings, identifying key variables such as manufacturing year, engine size, mileage, and transmission type to determine price trends.
Preprocessed data by handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling, converting categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding, ensuring model efficiency.
Built and optimized multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression) to predict car prices, comparing performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared values.
Validated model performance by implementing train-test splitting (60-40), cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning, improving predictive accuracy by 10% and reducing overfitting.
Investigated feature significance using p-value analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), identifying manufacturing year and engine size as key determinants of price while eliminating insignificant variables.
Applied Logistic Regression to analyze the impact of transmission type on car prices, achieving an 85% model accuracy, with insights validated using a Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve (AUC = 82%).
Utilized statistical and machine learning techniques, including correlation analysis, regression diagnostics, and regularization (Lasso & Ridge), to derive actionable insights for price estimation.
Derived key conclusions, showing that newer cars with lower mileage and larger engines have significantly higher prices, while manual transmissions tend to be priced lower than automatic ones.
